⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING ⚠️
Do NOT use the launcher’s uninstall option.

If you uninstall Among Us through the launcher, it will delete the entire folder where the game is installed — not just the game files. This could cause you to lose important files if you installed it in a main folder.

Please uninstall the game manually until the next update fixes this issue.
